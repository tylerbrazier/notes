Miscellaneous notes

Right now there's a mix of plain text and markdown files because I've gone
back and forth about which I prefer.

		Pros			Cons
txt:	- Simple/WYSIWYG	- Old, don't see it much anymore
	- No tools needed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
md:	- Nice rendering	- but not really in editor (boilerplate e.g.```)
	- Modern, "standard"	- but not really; many different implementations
				- Need to be aware of rules e.g. spacing around
				  lists and what characters to escape
				- Needs tooling for rendering and linting

Seems like markdown has more cons than pros. Plus, I spend 95% of the time
reading/editing the files in the editor, not the browser; when I'm editing
markdown I'm always thinking about how this will be rendered (and the rules to
make it render right) without seeing it rendered. Plus I value simplicity.
For these reasons I think I'm going to start migrating these md docs to txt.
