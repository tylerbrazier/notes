Alpine's wiki isn't as good as Arch's but it's better than nothing.

OpenRC reference:

	rc-service whatever start/stop/status

	rc-status     # status of services in current runlevel (-a for all)
	rc-status -s  # show all services
	rc-status -l  # list defined runlevels
	rc-status -c  # crashed services

	rc-update show  # see which services run at which runlevels
	rc-update add whatever default  # add service to runlevel
	rc-update delete whatever -a    # remove service from all runlevels

To install on my laptop, I flashed the standard image to a usb stick.
These are the steps I took to install Alpine along side Windows (dualboot).
This page really helped me understand booting & UEFI:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_boot_process
When booted from the usb stick:

	setup-alpine  # choose 'none' for disks, configs, & apk cache

	# Partitioning:
	# I made a root partition and
	# swap partition of size=RAM type="Linux Swap"
	apk add cfdisk
	cfdisk /dev/sdX
	mdev -s  # may need to repopulate /dev

	# Formating:
	apk add e2fsprogs
	fdisk -l  # double check device & partitions
	mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdXY
	mkswap /dev/sdXZ

	# Mount the root partition and esp:
	# (the laptop disk already had an esp on it)
	blkid  # check fs types
	mount -t ext4 /dev/sdXY /mnt
	mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
	mount -t vfat /dev/sdXE /mnt/boot/efi

	# esp/EFI/Boot/ already existed but setup-disk expects
	# "boot" with lower case letters so rename that first:
	mv /mnt/boot/efi/EFI/Boot /mnt/boot/efi/EFI/tmp
	mv /mnt/boot/efi/EFI/tmp /mnt/boot/efi/EFI/boot

	USE_EFI=1 setup-disk -v -m sys /mnt

	vi /mnt/etc/fstab
	# remove unnecessary mounts like esp and add:
	# /dev/sdXZ none swap defaults 0 0

	reboot

	# I also needed to adjust UEFI boot order from the laptop's BIOS menu.

Now boot from the disk and finish setting up:

	apk add \
	bash bash-completion
	openssh-client-default
	doas
	iwd
	git
	vim
	mpv
	brightnessctl
	alsa-utils
	slurp # for taking screenshots
	zzz   # for suspend and hibernate
	docs  # https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:FAQ#Documentation_for_all_packages

	# use iwd instead of wpa_supplicant
	rc-update delete wpa_supplicant -a
	apk del wpa_supplicant

	rc-update add iwd default
	rc-update add swap default
	rc-update add brightnessctl default

	setup-user -a tyler
	# or if you already added one during setup-alpine:
	adduser tyler wheel

	vi /etc/doas.d/doas.conf  # permit nopass :wheel

	# https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Change_default_shell
	vi /etc/passwd  # change tyler's shell to /bin/bash

	setup-desktop sway
	# remember to also install graphics drivers:
	# https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Sway#Install_Graphics_Drivers
	# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration

	doas -u tyler sway

	ssh-keygen

	# open firefox and add your ssh public key to github

	git clone git@github.com:tylerbrazier/dotfiles.git
	cd dotfiles
	./install.sh

	# After reboot you'll need to reconnect to wifi with iwd:
	doas iwctl
	station wlan0 connect <Tab><Tab>

TODO:
- reinstall to verify all these notes are right (can start sway w/o reboot?)
- hibernate
- don't wait for network, ntp, etc before giving login prompt
- autologin and auto start sway
- make reference notes about apk (e.g. show if pkg was installed as dep)
