## Split cross

A youtube guy said the overlap should equal the thickness of the bar
so for a 3" long 5/8" square bar:

      ________________________________________________
     /         (1+5/8")        /---cut-here-1+3/8"---/|
    /_______________________________________________/ |
    |                                               | |
    |-----cut-here-2+1/4"---------------|  (3/4")   | /
    |_______________________________________________|/
                              5/8" overlap

The top cut of 1 and 3/8" is conveniently the radius of the angle grinder wheel
