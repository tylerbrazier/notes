Hard toothbrush bristles wear away your gums and gums don't grow back. Buy soft
toothbrushes. You can run (preferably warm) water on the bristles before
pasting to soften those up a little.

In a relationship, if something bothers you about your partner, it's better
to address it sooner rather than later. For me at least, it's hard to point out
negative things about someone because I don't want to insult them and I don't
want to start a fight; but if I hold onto problems without telling them, they
don't even know it's a problem and they have no chance to correct it. That's not
fair to the other person and it only sits there and pokes you like a thorn in
your side. Just like if I have a piece of food on my face, I'd rather if
someone told me about it than let it sit there.

Try not to be intolerant of things or people (e.g. inefficient stoplights or
crappy software for me). Intolerance just makes for a unopened mind and helps
to ruin your day.

Rewarding things require upfront effort. You're only proud of the things you
worked for. There's a tradeoff between satisfaction now vs later. Delayed
gratification also tends to come with the bonus of "I feel good about myself";
instant gratification tends to result in feelings of guilt.

When you breakup with someone, it's best to bite the bullet and disconnect from
that person as much as possible. A relationship is like Velcro and the fewer
ties you have to that person the easier it will be separate from them. Avoid
talking with that person, delete all of your pictures together, get rid of
their gifts to you, and stop following them on social media. The fewer
reminders you have of that person, the easier it will be to move forward.
