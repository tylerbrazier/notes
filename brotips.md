Hard toothbrush bristles wear away your gums and gums don't grow back. Buy soft
toothbrushes. You can run (preferably warm) water on the bristles before
pasting to soften those up a little.

In a relationship, if something bothers you about your partner, it's better
to address it sooner rather than later. For me at least, it's hard to point out
negative things about someone because I don't want to insult them and I don't
want to start a fight; but if I hold onto problems without telling them, they
don't even know it's a problem and they have no chance to correct it. That's not
fair to the other person and it only sits there and pokes you like a thorn in
your side. Just like if I have a piece of food on my face, I'd rather if
someone told me about it than let it sit there.

Try not to be intolerant of things or people (e.g. inefficient stoplights or
crappy software for me). Intolerance just makes for a unopened mind and helps
to ruin your day.
