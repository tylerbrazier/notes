Need:
- Tube(s) of 100% silicone
- solvent (1 Gal is enough for 4L of fabric)
- calking gun
- knife to cut end of tube (if the gun doesn't have)
- rubber gloves (backup pair is handy)
- tarp to put down (it's a messy job)
- paper towels for cleanup
- container to measure out liters of fluid
- garbage bag
- 5 Gal bucket is handy
- clothesline to hang dry
Naptha & mineral spirits both work as solvent.
5:1 ratio of solvent:silicone.
Need about as much solvent as 3/4 of the volume of fabric;
so a standard 290ml (9.8floz) tube of silicone and ~1.5L (50floz) of solvent
will be enough for ~2L of fabric.
(1 tube silicone & 1.5L Naptha was plenty enough for my 5'x5' bedsheet tarp.)
