The four phases of translation:

   program.c file
      |
      V
 Preprocessing: removes //comments, expands all #include/define/etc
      |
      | preprocessed.i file (still C)
      V
  Compiling: translates C into assembly
      |
      | assembly.s file (still text)
      V
  Assembling: translates assembly into machine code
      |
      | object.o file (binary)
      V
   Linking: resolves references between objects
      |
      V
    a.out file (executable)
