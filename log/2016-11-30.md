I've been feeling kind of bitter and angry the last few days and I haven't been
able to reasonably explain why. I decided to go for a walk after work because I
needed to pray. I asked God for help because I've been feeling miserable for no
good reason. At some point earlier in the day, I was reminded of somebody
telling me that he takes depression pills. I've always thought that people who
resort to drugs to help them with their emotional issues are weak. On the walk, 
God reminded me, "this is how some people feel all the time." Some people have
have no hope. It's easy for me to condescend other people for issues that I
don't have.

It's a good lessen and he told me to write it down. I've realized that I rarely
go out and walk with him unless I have something wrong going on in my life. I
think one major contributor to my shitty feelings recently is the feeling of
worthlessness; "what am I supposed to do with my life" and such. He reminded me
tonight that this is what I should be doing now; learning from him and writing
it down. I can be doing whatever else besides but this is important.
