One thing I often forget about "love your neighbor as yourself" is the "as
yourself" part. God wants us to love ourselves. What dad wouldn't? To love
myself does not mean doing things where I indulge in the moment. In fact,
that's exactly what I should *not* be doing because that generally means I'm
going to feel guilty afterwards. I should do things that make me proud, and
that often means giving up immediate satisfaction. One example of this is
working out; it's not something I generally look forward to but the payoff
comes afterwards. I suppose life before heaven is somewhat similar.
No one ever took pride in taking the path of least resistance.
