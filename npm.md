- `npm init`: initialize package.json in a new project
- `npm i[nstall] --save[-dev] <package>`: install a new package and add it to deps in package.json
- `npm i[nstall]`: install all packages listed in package.json
- `npm outdated`: see which packages in package.json are out of date

You probably want to add `node_modules/` and `npm-debug.log` to your project's `.gitignore`.
