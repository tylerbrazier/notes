I've shaved with electric shavers, cartridge razors, and safety razor. I like
the safety razor the most because (a) it's easier to travel with since it's
smaller and doesn't need to plug in and (b) cartridge razors would always give
me ingrown hairs.

I don't need shaving cream; soapy water seems to work even better because it's
more slippery and I can see through it.

When a blade gets dull, you can flip it upside down to get more uses out of it.
