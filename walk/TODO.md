# Things to look into or think about
- Luke 16:8 what does this mean?
- Luke 9:27 what does this mean?
- God desires we all come to Him freely, and God allows evil. Since He allows it does He to some degree desire it? He has power over everything so if He doesn't desire it why does He allow it to exist?
- think about parallels: they do exist, even between heaven and earth. Jesus used parallels (parables) to explain things.
