# Abortion
This is a touchy subject and these are just my personal views on it. I don't
think I could classify myself as pro-choice or pro-life because I don't think
it's that black and white.

I don't like the idea of wanting the option to choose in order to avoid the
consequences of having sex at the cost of someone else's life. That's just
selfish. On the other hand, I don't think it's fair to tell a pregnant woman
that she must deliver when it could endanger her life.

I don't think the act itself is right or wrong but the intent behind it that
matters.
