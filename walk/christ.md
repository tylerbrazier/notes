The words Christ and Messiah are derived from Greek and Hebrew words meaning
"anointed". See [here][0] for more on that.

(January 2016) I used to be confused about the idea that Jesus sacrificed
himself so that we are saved from our sins; if we're the ones who are sinning,
shouldn't we be making the sacrifice? Then I thought about what a sacrifice is:
giving up something of value for the sake of someone else. I realized that God
loves us so much that *He* is willing to make the sacrifice to appeal to us,
even though we sin against him ([1 John 4:10][], [John 3:16][]). He turned the
other cheek ([Matthew 5:38-40][]). We only have to recognize his sacrifice
([John 3:36][], [John 8:24][], [Acts 16:31][], [John 3:15][], [John 5:24][],
[John 14:6][], [Romans 10:9][], [1 John 4:15][]). That is the way we ought to
love each other ([1 John 4:11][], [Matthew 5:48][]). 1 John 4 is a great
reference on this one.

(July 2018) It is also Jesus who is the final judge, not God himself; God has
made him the judge ([John 5:21-23][], [Matthew 25:31-46][], [2 Timothy 4:1][],
[John 14:6][]).
