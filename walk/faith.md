When I started thinking about faith, the first thing I asked myself is how I
would define it. I suppose a person's measure of faith is their measure of
confidence and trust in God, that he will do what he says he will do
([Hebrews 11:1][Hebrews 11:1]).

There are a lot of evidence for the necessity and power of faith:

- [James 1:5-6][James 1:5-6]
- [Hebrews 11:6][Hebrews 11:6]
- [James 5:15][James 5:15]
- [Mark 2:5][Mark 2:5], [Luke 5:19-20][Luke 5:19-20]
- [Matthew 9:20-22][Matthew 9:20-22], [Mark 5:34][Mark 5:34], [Luke 8:48][Luke 8:48]
- [Matthew 9:27-30][Matthew 9:27-30], [Mark 10:51-52][Mark 10:51-52], [Luke 18:41-43][Luke 18:41-43]
- [Matthew 13:58][Matthew 13:58], [Mark 6:5-6][Mark 6:5-6]
- [Matthew 17:20][Matthew 17:20]
- [Luke 17:6][Luke 17:6]
- [Matthew 15:28][Matthew 15:28]
- [Matthew 21:21][Matthew 21:21], [Mark 11:22-24][Mark 11:22-24]
- [Luke 17:19][Luke 17:19]

It seems to me that a prayer without faith isn't worth much.

[Romans 10:17][Romans 10:17] says the source of faith is hearing Christ's word.
We hear his word by reading the Bible and by what he shows us through prayer.
If we maintain a relationship with him, he will stay close to us
([James 4:8][James 4:8], [2 Chronicles 15:2][2 Chronicles 15:2],
[Zechariah 1:3][Zechariah 1:3], [Malachi 3:7][Malachi 3:7]). Like anybody else,
the better my relationship with him is, the more I can trust and have
confidence in him. You will not believe until you experience for yourself, and
you get that experience by being close with him.
