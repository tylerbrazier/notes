(2017-02-12) Through a series of circumstances, I was led to the conclusion
that I should fast for a day (only water), so I did. That day I went for a walk
and pondered about what fasting is and the following what I came up with.

I realized that in the bible, fasting is often accompanied by prayer
([Daniel 9:3][], [Matthew 17:21][], [Acts 14:23][], [Nehemiah 1:4][],
[Psalms 35:13][]). It is supplication and when you fast you demonstrate to God
that you're serious about whatever you're praying for.

Prayer and fasting is like an appeal, and I believe that fasting for the sake
of fasting (like lent) doesn't have as much value as when you have an intent.

The body and the spirit are opposed to each other ([Galatians 5:16-17][],
[Romans 8:6][], [Romans 8:13][]) and when you fast you're denying the body and
it's much easier for the spirit to come in.
