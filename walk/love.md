(December 2015) Throughout my whole teenage life, my stance on fornication (sex
before marriage) was that as long as she's okay with it, then so am I. However,
nearly all of the genuine Christians that I've known don't condone it and I
decided to question why it's such a big deal. First, where do you draw the line
between what's acceptable and what's not? Is foreplay acceptable? At what point
is kissing acceptable? I decided to generalize these things under the category
of "intimacy". Next I thought about what marriage is: I suppose it's a kind of
contract where each promises to give themselves completely to the other.

For weeks I had thought about this and could not come up with anything to
convince myself why premarital sex is such a big deal. I went for a walk and
asked God to tell me something that could make me understand. He asked me, "So,
if you love a girl, how do you feel about her previous intimacy with other
guys?" I realized that even though it happened in the past, hearing about my
partner's previous relations made me feel cheated now. Then he said to me,
"Isn't that interesting, love isn't bound by time."

I was awestruck. I though about [1 John 4:8][] (God is love). I realized that
this thing we call love is powerful force that has us abandon our natural
instincts to seek our own happiness and pleasure in favor of somebody else; it
is selfless. It occurred to me that when you marry someone, you promise that
person that you will love them forever - time is not a factor in the contract.
If you are intimate with someone before you make that contract, you're
violating that person and hurting the future man or woman who will be their
spouse. If you can't commit to loving that person forever, time remains a
factor and you're not being intimate with that person out of love, but lust
([Galatians 5:17][]). The only person who deserves your body is the one who
will promise to be with you until one of you dies. If you truly love someone,
you will put aside your own desires for the sake of that person's future
spouse.

All of this came to mind at once and I remember looking up at the sky and
saying, "Oh my God". I fell on my knees and I cried. I had thought about this
for weeks and I couldn't come up with a satisfying answer but he gave me
understanding in two sentences. I realized how elegant he is and how well he
knows me. I felt what is known as the fear of the LORD and felt so privileged
that he would talk to me. I'm affirmed that he does show himself to us if we
seek him ([Proverbs 8:17][]).
