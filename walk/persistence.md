A relationship with God is like a muscle: it withers if it isn't used.  For
myself, I've noticed that when everything in my life is going just fine, I get
complacent and I don't focus on him as much. When things are going bad, *then*
I need him and ask for his help; it's human nature. Because of this, I think
that it's good for things to go bad sometimes. The closest I've felt to him
was in my own times of need. ([2 Corinthians 12:9-10][])


[2 Corinthians 12:9-10]: https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb/2Corinthians/12/9-10
  "(NET) 12:9 But he said to me, “My grace is enough for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” So then, I will boast most gladly about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may reside in me. 10 Therefore I am content with weaknesses, with insults, with troubles, with persecutions and difficulties for the sake of Christ, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong."
