It's easy for me to pray for what I want. It's better for me to pray for
understanding what God wants me to do. This is how Jesus operated ([John
5:30][John 5:30], [John 8:28][John 8:28], [Luke 22:42][Luke 22:42]). If I do
what he would have me do, and have faith, then he will do good things for me
([Romans 8:28][Romans 8:28], [Hebrews 11:6][Hebrews 11:6],
[Matthew 6:25-34][Matthew 6:25-34]); what kind of dad wouldn't want the best
for his kids?


[John 5:30]: https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb/John/5/30 "(NET) 5:30 I can do nothing on my own initiative. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the one who sent me. "
[John 8:28]: https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb/John/8/28 "(NET) 8:28 Then Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing on my own initiative, but I speak just what the Father taught me. "
[Luke 22:42]: https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb/Luke/22/42 "(NET) 22:42 “Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done.” "
[Romans 8:28]: https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb/Romans/8/28 "(NET) 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose, "
[Hebrews 11:6]: https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb/Hebrews/11/6 "(NET) 11:6 Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. "
[Matthew 6:25-34]: https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb/Matthew/6/25-34 "(NET) Do Not Worry6:25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Isn’t there more to life than food and more to the body than clothing? 26 Look at the birds in the sky: They do not sow, or reap, or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you more valuable than they are? 27 And which of you by worrying can add even one hour to his life? 28 Why do you worry about clothing? Think about how the flowers of the field grow; they do not work or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these! 30 And if this is how God clothes the wild grass, which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat the oven, won’t he clothe you even more, you people of little faith? 31 So then, don’t worry saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ 32 For the unconverted pursue these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But above all pursue his kingdom and righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 So then, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own. "
