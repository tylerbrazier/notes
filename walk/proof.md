One night on a walk I saw graffiti on a train car: "Where are the facts?" with
crosses drawn around it. It made me wonder why God doesn't make himself more
apparent, especially to those who doubt.

I suppose it means more to him when we take the effort to seek him
([Proverbs 8:17][]). If God showed his power to everybody, it would reduce the
value of our free will to nothing. He wants to be loved by us
([Deuteronomy 6:5][], [Matthew 22:37][], [Mark 12:30][], [Luke 10:27][]) and if
we really knew him the value of our love would be nothing. How rewarding would
it be if you forced someone to love you? We can only love to the extent of our
freedom.

God *does* show himself, but we have to look for him ([Jeremiah 29:13][],
[Matthew 7:7-8][], [Luke 11:9-10][]) and he is a rewarder of those who seek him
([Hebrews 11:6][]).
